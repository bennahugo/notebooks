# Basic radio astronomy with TART data

To get started with processing all sky data from the TART work through the example notebooks presented
in this repository.    
Example notebooks are python jupyter notebooks and can be executed using COLAB.

The standard output format for the all sky data from the
[Transient Array Radio Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_Array_Radio_Telescope)
is the Python JSON file format.
The easiest for radio astronomers to view and inspect the data is to convert the JSON files to the
CASA Measurement Set standard using `tart2ms`.
* Software and instruction on the installation and use of `tart2ms` can be found in the
[tart2ms](https://github.com/tart-telescope/tart2ms)
repository
* Example TART data can be found in the [test_data](../test_data) folder of this repository.
